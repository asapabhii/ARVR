# 360° Product Demo Virtual Tour

**Domain:** Product Demo  
**Purpose:** Let users explore a 360-degree view of a product, interact with hotspots to learn more about its features, and navigate naturally as if “walking” around the product.

## Features
- 360° immersive view with mouse drag (desktop) & gyroscope (mobile)
- 3+ interactive hotspots with info pop ups and smooth camera focus
- Avatar marker with navigation controls
- Fully mobile responsive & modern UI

## Hotspots & Navigation
- See `main.js` for hotspot and avatar coordinates/config

## Avatar Implementation
- Simple circular marker visually placed at screen edge (real avatar walking in 3D is possible with more resources)
- Avatar moves to preset positions (change AVATAR_LOCATIONS for custom locations)

## How to deploy:
1. Add your 360° image + closeups to `assets/`
2. Push to GitHub
3. In repo settings -> Pages, set branch to `main` and folder to `/root`
4. Done!
